# How do I Open This?

When I'm working on code, I have to open a lot of files.  I work primarily at the command line, inside a `vim` editor.  On any given day I may need to translate some or all of the following into file paths that `vim` can understand:

* Stack traces
* Perl module names
* Perl module names suffixed with subroutine names
* `git-grep` results
* GitHub URLs

Figuring this stuff out isn't generally that hard, but it can make your day just a little longer than it needs to be, so I wrote [ot](https://metacpan.org/pod/ot): a command line utility provided by [Open::This](https://metacpan.org/pod/Open::This)

I'll be using `vim` in examples, but [ot](https://metacpan.org/pod/ot) also supports `nvim`, `emacs`,`nano` and `pico`, defaulting to whatever you have set in `$ENV{EDITOR}`.

## Following Along

I'll be working out of a repository at [https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers](https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers).  If you'd like to follow along:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers.git
cd git-helpers
```

## Using a Perl Module Name

We're now in the root of the **git-helpers** `Git` repository.  Let's say we want to open the `Git::Helpers` module.  Translating a Perl module name into a file path isn't all that hard.  Given something like `Git::Helpers`, I know that I'm likely (but not always) looking for a file called `Git/Helpers.pm`.  This could be in `lib`, `t/lib` or some custom directory.  If I know exactly where to find this file, I can invoke `vim` directly: `vim lib/Git/Helpers.pm`.

However, if I'm not sure, or if I'm just lazy, this will get me to the same place: `ot Git::Helpers`.

This works because, by default, `ot` will search your `lib` and `t/lib` directories for local files. You can override this via the `$ENV{OPEN_THIS_LIBS}` variable. It accepts a comma-separated list of libs.

If the file can't be found in one of the standard lib locations, `ot` will try to find an installed file on the system.  So, if we're not in the root of the `git-helpers` repository, but we've previously installed `Git::Helpers` from CPAN, `ot Git::Helpers` might open the following file: 

`~/.plenv/versions/5.26.1/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.26.1/Git/Helpers.pm`




## Opening a Perl Module at a Subroutine Declaration

Let's take this a step further.  What if we want to open a file for a module but we also want to go straight to the correct subroutine declaration?  Something like `Git::Helpers::is_inside_work_tree()`.  We could probably craft a fancy one-liner to do this, but today we are lazy.

`ot "Git::Helpers::is_inside_work_tree()"`
 
That's it.  This will Do The Right Thing.  (Note that in this case we had to quote the args to `ot`.  Your shell will likely require this as well.)

We can do exactly the same thing for an installed module.  Try this command:

`ot "Test::More::subtest()"` 

In my case it opens `/.plenv/versions/5.26.1/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.26.1/Test/More.pm` at line 807, which is `sub subtest {`.

## Opening a File Using a Line Number

### Stack Traces
I see a lot of stack traces on any given day.  A relevant chunk of a strack trace might look like: `Died at lib/Git/Helpers.pm line 50.`

Doing this by hand I might copy the file path and enter the following at the command line: `vim lib/Git/Helpers.pm`.

If I'm feeling fancy, I might translate the line number into something that `vim` understands: `vim +50 lib/Git/Helpers.pm`.

Or, I can just copy the file location and line number and feed it to `ot`: `ot lib/Git/Helpers.pm line 50`

This will do the right thing and open `lib/Git/Helpers.pm` in `vim` at line 50.

### git-grep

The results of some searches, like `git grep`, can contain line numbers as well as file names.  To configure this behaviour in `git` use the following command `git config --global grep.lineNumber true`.  If you don't want to configure this directly in `git` you can also search via `git grep --line-number foo`.

Now that we've got line numbers in our `git grep` output, we can use its output to give hints to `ot`:

```bash
$ git grep 'sub _build_latest_release' .
lib/Git/Helpers/CPAN.pm:70:sub _build_latest_release {
```

Having run the above search, we can copy paste the results to `ot`:


```
ot lib/Git/Helpers/CPAN.pm:70`
```

This will now open `lib/Git/Helpers/CPAN.pm` at line 70.

## Opening a File at an Arbitrary Line and Column

As we saw above, `ot` can open files at the correct line number.  Let's get even lazier and have `ot` open our files at the correct line **and** column.

If you use  the `--vimgrep` option with `ripgrep` then you will see column numbers as well as line numbers with your search results.  For example:

```bash
$ rg --vimgrep '_build_latest_release' .
./lib/Git/Helpers/CPAN.pm:20:17:    builder => '_build_latest_release',
./lib/Git/Helpers/CPAN.pm:70:5:sub _build_latest_release {
```

To open `lib/Git/Helpers/CPAN.pm` at line 20 and column 17, simply copy/paste the `rg` output and pass it to `ot`:

```bash
ot ./lib/Git/Helpers/CPAN.pm:20:17
```

## Opening Github Links Locally:

Passing a full GitHub URL [https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers/blob/master/lib/Git/Helpers.pm#L50](https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers/blob/master/lib/Git/Helpers.pm#L50), to `ot` will allow you to open the file locally, if it can be found in your relative file path.

```
ot https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers/blob/master/lib/Git/Helpers.pm#L50
```

opens `lib/Git/Helpers.pm` at line 50.

Passing a truncated URL path is also valid, if the path parts exist locally:

```
ot lib/Git/Helpers.pm#L50
```

## Opening a Locally Checked Out File at GitHub

The `-b` flag will allow you to open your local files on GitHub.

Any of the following commands can launch a browser with a GitHub URL (hopefully) containing the file you want:

* `ot -b Git::Helpers`
* `ot -b "Git::Helpers::is_inside_work_tree()"`
* `ot -b Git::Helpers:75`
* `ot -b Git::Helpers line 75`

For example, from the top level of the git-helpers repository:

```bash
ot -b Git::Helpers:75
```
opens [https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers/blob/master/lib/Git/Helpers.pm#L75](https://github.com/oalders/git-helpers/blob/master/lib/Git/Helpers.pm#L75).


## Opening a File in Your $ENV{PATH}

`ot` can also be used as a shortcut to inspect files which can be found inside your `$ENV{PATH}`.

For example:

```bash
ot perldoc
```

opens `~/.plenv/versions/5.26.1/bin/perldoc` on my machine.  You can think of this as shorthand for:

```
which perldoc | xargs -o vim
```
