[L.O.S.T.](http://lostswimming.com/) (the Lake Ontario Swim Team) began in 2007 with a handful of swimmers.  It is now one of the largest open water swim groups in the world.  The group swims weekly from June to September in Oakville, ON. 60-120 participants brave the waters at any given swim. Members drive in from long distances, even as far as Virginia.  Saturday drop-in visits from around the world are a regular occurrence.

Many triathletes use L.O.S.T. as a vital part of their open water (and cold water) training.  2019 temperatures have ranged from 7 to 16 C, making L.O.S.T. a good starting point for everything from a local triathlon to the chilly Isklar Norseman.

The annual [L.O.S.T. race](http://lostswimming.com/lost-race/) (with 3.8km and 1 mile distances) is popular with Ironman athletes.  It has grown from 8 swimmers in 2008 to over 200 swimmers.

L.O.S.T. members have crossed the English channel, [competed in the Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Escobar_(swimmer)) or even [raced in a frozen lake](http://lostswimming.com/2018/02/27/losties-hit-vermont-for-ice-swimming-races/). Some simply swim outdoors year round.

L.O.S.T. brings together triathletes and open water swimmers in a fun, supportive environment.  "No salt. No sharks. No worries."
